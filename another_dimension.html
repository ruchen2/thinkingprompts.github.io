  <h2>Another Dimension</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Difficulties involved in moving or relocating an object along a line are removed if the object acquires the ability to move in two dimensions (along a plane).  Accordingly, problems connected with movement or relocation of an object on one plane are removed by switching to a three-dimensional space</li>
    <li>Use a multi-story arrangement of objects instead of a single-story arrangement. Use a multi-layered assembly of objects instead of a single layer</li>
    <li>Tilt or re-orient the object, lay it on its side</li>
    <li>Use another side of a given area</li>
    <li>Use optical lines falling onto neighboring areas or onto the reverse side of the area available</li>
 </ul>
