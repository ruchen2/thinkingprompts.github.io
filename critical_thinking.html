<h2>Questions for Critical Thinking</h2>
<ul>
  <li><h3>Interpretation</h3></li>
    <ul>
      <li>What does this mean?</li>
      <li>What's happening?</li>
      <li>How should we understand that(e.g. what he or she just said)?</li>
      <li>What is the best way to characterize/categorize/classify this?</li>
      <li>In this context, what was intended by saying/doing that?</li>
      <li>How can we make sense out of this (experience, feeling, statement)?</li>
    </ul>
  <li><h3>Analysis</h3></li>
     <ul>
       <li>Could you please tell us again your reasons for making that claim?</li>
       <li>What is your conclusion/WHat is it that you are claiming?</li>
       <li>Why do you think that?</li>
       <li>What are the arguments pro and con?</li>
       <li>What assumptions must have make to accept the conclusion?</li>
       <li>What is your basis for saying that?</li>
    </ul>
  <li><h3>Inference</h3></li>
     <ul>
       <li>Given what we know so far, what conclusions can we draw?</li>
       <li>Given what we know so far, what can we rule out?</li>
       <li>What does this evidence imply?</li>
       <li>If we abandoned/accepted that assumption,how would things change?</li>
       <li>What additional information do we need to resolve this question?</li>
       <li>If we believe these things, what would they imply for us going forward?</li>
       <li>What are the consequence of doing things that way?</li>
       <li>What are some alternatives we haven't explored?</li>
       <li>Let's consider each option and see where it takes us.</li>
       <li>Are there any undesirable consequences that we can and should foresee? </li>    
    </ul>
  <li><h3>Evaluation</h3></li>
      <ul>
        <li>How credible is that claim?</li>
        <li>Why do we think we can trust what this person claims?</li>
        <li>How strong are those arguments?</li>
        <li>Do we have our facts right?</li>
        <li>How confident can we be in our conclusion, given what we now know? </li>   
    </ul>
  <li><h3>Explanation</h3></li>
        <ul>
          <li>What were the specific findings/results of the investigation?</li>
          <li>Could you please tell us how you conducted that analysis?</li>
          <li>How did you come to that interpretation?</li>
          <li>Could you please take us through your reasoning one more time?</li>
          <li>Why do you think that (was the right answer/was the soltuion)?</li>
          <li>How would you explain why this particular decision was made?</li>
    </ul>
  <li><h3>Self-Regulatioin</h3></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Our position on this issue is still too vague; can we be more precise?</li>
          <li>How good was our methodology, and how well did we follow it?</li>
          <li>Is there a way we reconcile these two apparently conflicting conclusions?</li>
          <li>How good is our evidence?</li>
          <li>OK, before we commit, what are we missing?</li>
          <li>I'm finding some our our definitions a little confusing; can we revisit what we mean by certain things before making any final decisions?</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
