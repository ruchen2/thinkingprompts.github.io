  <h2>Division</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>List internal components of the challenge.</li>
    <li>Divide the challenge in one of three ways:</li>
	<ul>
	  <li>Take a component and rearrange its location or timing.</li>
	  <li>Cut a component along any physical line and rearrange it.</li>
	  <li>Divide the challenge into smaller pieces, which still possess all the characteristics of the whole.</li>
	</ul>
    <li>Imagine the resulting concept.</li>
    <li>Ask questions:</li>
	<ul>
	  <li>What are the potential benefits?</li>
	  <li>Who would want the new idea?</li>
	  <li>If you are trying to solve a specific problem, how can the idea help address that particular challenge?</li>
