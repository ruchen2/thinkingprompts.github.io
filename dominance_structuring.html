  <h2>Understand Dominance Structuring and Avoid Locking-In Prematurely</h2>
   <ul>
     	<li>Dominance structuring is the human tendency to lock in to a decision. This is an extremely valuable characteristic</li>
     	<li>Benefits: gaining confidence, swinging into action, persevering during difficulties, and sustaining commitments</li>
     	<li>Risk: locking into an unwise decision</li>
     	<li>Dominance structuring has four phases</li>
		<ol>
     		<li>Pre-editing: select a group of possible options and a number of decision-critical attributes</li>
     		<li>Identifying one promising option: find one alternative that is more attractive than the others on at least one critically important attribute</li>
     		<li>Testing the promising option: compare the promising alternative to the other options in terms of the set of decision-critical attributes. Focus on seeing whether it has any salient disadvantages or major drawbacks</li>
     		<li>Fortifying the to-be-chosen option: restructure our appraisals of the options so as to achieve the dominance of one option over the others. Use de-emphasizing, bolstering, trading off, and collapsing attributes</li>	
		</ol>
     	<li>Avoid locking in to an unwise decision using critical thinking strategies in each phase of the search for dominance</li>
