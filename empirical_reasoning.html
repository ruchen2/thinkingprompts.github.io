  <h2>Recognize empirical reasoning</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>"Bottom-Up" Thinking</li>
     <li>Empirical reasoning is the process that proceeds from premises describing interpersonally verifiable experiences in order to support or to disconfirm hypotheses, which, in turn, are intended to explain and predict phenomena</li>
     <li>Empirical reasoning is inductive</li>
     <li>Empirical reasoning is self-corretive</li>
     <li>Empirical reasoning is open to independent verification</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Evaluate empirical reasoning</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>Truthfulness of premises</li>
     <li>Logical strength</li>
     <li>Relevancy</li>
     <li>Non-circularity</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Benefits of empirical reasoning</h2>

  <h2>Risks of empirical reasoning</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>It would be a mistake to think that a hypothesis was not true simply because an empirical inquiry failed to provide evidence that supports that hypothesis</li>
     <li>It would be a mistake to think that findings that have been established with a high level of confidence can never be rejected, revised, or refined</li>
  </ul>
