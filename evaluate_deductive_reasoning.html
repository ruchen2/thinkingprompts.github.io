  <h2>Evalute Deductive Reasoning</h2>
  <ul>
     <li>Reason deductively about declarative statements</li>
	<ul>
     	<li>Denying the consequence: (1)If A, then B. (2)Not B. (3)Therefore, not A</li>
     	<li>Affirming the antecedent: (1)If A, then B. (2)A. (3)Therefore, B</li>
	<li>Disjunctive syllogism: (1)Either A or B. (2)Not A. (3)Therefore, B</li>
	</ul>
     <li>Reason deductively about classes of objects</li> 
  	<ul>	
     	<li>Applying a generalization: (1)Every member of F is a member of G. (2)Individual object X is a member of F. (3)So, X is a member of G</li>
	<li>Applying an exception: (1)Every F is a G. (2)The object X is not a G. (3)So, X is not an F</li>
  	</ul>
     <li>Reason deductively about relationships</li> 
  	<ul>	
     	<li>Transitivity: If X has a transitive relationship to Y, and Y has the same transitive reationship to Z, then X has the same transitive relationship to Z</li>
	<li>Reflectivity: If X has a reflective relationship to Y, then Y has the same reflective relationship to X</li>
	<li>Identity: If X is Y, then Y is X</li>
  	</ul>    
     <li>Fallacies disguising as valid deductive arguments</li>
	<ul>
     	<li>Fallacy of affirming the consequence: (1)If A, then B. (2)B. (3)Therefore, A</li>
     	<li>Fallacy of denying the antecedent: (1)If A, then B. (2)Not A. (3)Therefore, not B</li>
     	<li>Fallacy of false classification: One group is classified as part of the other group because both have the same attribute</li>
	<li>Fallacy of composition: A group has exactly the same attribute that each of its members have</li>
	<li>Fallacy of division: Each individual member of a group has the same attribute that the group as a whole has</li>
	<li>Fallacy of false reference: Two descriptions refer the same thing</li>
	</ul>
  </ul>
