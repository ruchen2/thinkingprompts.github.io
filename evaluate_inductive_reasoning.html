  <h2>Evalute Inductive Reasoning</h2>
  <ul>
     <li>Evaluate generalization</li>
	<ul>
     	<li>Was the correct group sampled?</li>
     	<li>Were the data obtained in an effective way?</li>
     	<li>Were enough cases considered?</li>
     	<li>Was the sample representatively structured?</li>
	</ul>
     <li>Distinguish coincidences, correlations, and causes </li>  
     <li>Fallacies disguising as strong inductive arguments</li>
	<ul>
     	<li>Erroneous generalization: generalizations, even those based on solid evidence, can be deceptively fallacious, too (for example, exaggeration)</li>
     	<li>Playing with numbers: selectely use of raw numbers or percentages, provide numbers without sufficient information</li>
     	<li>False dilemma (the either/or fallacy): more options emerge on further examination</li>
     	<li>The gambler's fallacy: wrongly assume that what happened by chance is somehow correlated or causally connected with things we can control</li>
     	<li>False cause</li>
	    <ul>     	
		<li>Confuse temporal proximity with causuality: since event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event X</li>
		<li>Confuse a correlation with cause</li>
		<li>Confuse symptons, outcomes, or intentions with causes</li>
	    </ul>
     	<li>Slippery Slope</li>
		<li>Wrongly assume that discrete events are linked together so that the first step in the process necessarily results in some significant, usually bad, consequences way down the road somewhere</li>
	</ul>
  </ul>
