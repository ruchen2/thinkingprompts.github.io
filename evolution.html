  <h2>Evolution of Technique</h2>
  <ul>
    <h3>Both the quantity and quality of human needs, as well as requirements for humans, increase with time</h3>

    <h3>Any technique's evolution brings the increase of its ideality</h3>
    <li>Multiplication: transition from mono-system to bi-system to poly-system</li>
    <li>Trimming: decrease in number of subsystems for neutral and auxiliary functions</li>
    <li>Poly-functionality: increased quantity of useful functions by adding new subsystems</li>
    <li>Aggregation: achieve many functions within or by one subsystem</li>
    <li></li>
    <li>Dehumanization: exclude people from performing a noncreative work through mechanization, automation, and computerization</li>
    <li>Resource: achieve low cost by use of various resources</li>
    <li>Minimization: achieve the smallest dimensions, smallest weight, and smallest energy consumption of any subsystem</li>
    <li>New materials: substitute current materials with new ones with advantageous properties, some of which can provide useful functions</li>
    <li></li>
    <li>Encapsulation: put replaceable subsystems into a more easily handled cassette or cartridge</li>
    <li>Modular construction: connect the construction elements into suitable groups</li>
    <li>Standardization: unify the dimensions, forms, and other properties and values of subsystems</li>
    <li>Typification: establish the optimum number of variants and sizes of selected characteristic properties of a particular technique</li>
    <li>Reuse: use subsystems that have already been designed and tested for a previous application as some of the subsystems of the new system </li>
    <li>Recycling: use elements of dead technique as newe materials in new technique</li>
    <li></li>

    <h3>Each technique and each subsystem has its own representative time of evolution</h3>
    <h3>Any technique with nonsingle subsystems has a few time scale during technique development</h3>
    <li>Uniformity: The uneven development of subsystems leads to existence of contradictions in a technique</li>
    <li>Completeness: a tehnical system will not work if one important subsystem is missing or does not perform well</li>
    <li>Transparency: a technique will not work if one of the energy/sustance/information links is missing or does not perform well</li>
    <li></li>
   </ul>

 <h2>Paths of Evolution</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Physical states: solid - liquid - gas - plasma - field - vacuum</li>
    <li>Interaction: continuous - vibration - resonance</li>
    <li>Dimensionality: zero D - 1D - 2D - 3D</li>
    <li>Adaptability: rigid - dynamic - multi-hinges - elastic - soft - field flexibility</li>
    <li>Voidness: monolith - inhomogenous solid - solid with voids - solid with capillaries - porous solid - solid with dispersed micro-voids</li>
    <li>Human involvement: mechnization  - automation - computerization</li>
    <li></li>

 </ul>
